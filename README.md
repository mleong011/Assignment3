# Deploying Python app with Heroku and Travis CI 

### Using Travis CI, Heroku, and this GitHub repo I was able to deploy my python app.
  
  * Made a copy of the Assignment 1 repo (the files of Python app that connects to the NASA API for the picture of the day.) into this repository.
  * Created a YAML file containing information for Travis CI to deploy the app to Heroku.
  * link to travis-ci.com build status: [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/mleong011/Assignment3 )
  * link to python app created hosted on Heroku: https://assign3-nasapod.herokuapp.com

> This assignment was very challenging and required a lot of reading and research about continuous integration and the building process. 
>
> There are still a lot of things im not too clear on like what kind of tests I should be running and if there are additional things that should be added to the YAML file. 
>
> Although it was challenging, it was very exciting to see the end result of my work being deployed to heroko and the ability to access it like any other website. 
> 
>It was a **struggle**, but it was fun! Thanks!
